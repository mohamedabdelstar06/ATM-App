## 📌 About the Project

This is a simple yet complete ATM Console Application built in C#, designed and developed entirely by me 👨‍💻.  
The project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in practice, and showcases how to structure a small but real-world console application.

It's based on a tutorial from YouTube, but I built it from scratch myself — adding my own touch, structure, and improvements to truly understand how to implement OOP and improve code organization.

## ✨ Features

✅ User login with card number & PIN validation  
✅ Account balance check  
✅ Cash deposit (with amount validation & note summary)  
✅ Withdrawal (predefined amounts or custom)  
✅ Internal transfer to other accounts  
✅ View transactions (pending implementation)  
✅ Clean, modular, and extendable code following OOP best practices

## 🛠 Technologies & Skills Applied

- **C#** (.NET)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Enums, Interfaces)
- Data validation & user input handling
- Console UI & menus
- Project structuring in Visual Studio

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the project and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedabdelstar06/ATM-App.git
cd ATM-App
# Open in Visual Studio and run
🎥 Project Idea & Inspiration
In this project, I practiced and applied key OOP concepts, including:

Creating the Visual Studio project and structuring it properly

Designing classes, interfaces, and enums to keep code organized

Writing the ATM logic: login, transactions, deposits, withdrawals, transfers

Handling validation, error messages, and user experience in the console

The idea comes from a two-part tutorial:

Part 1: Welcome screen, login system, validating card number & PIN

Part 2: Displaying menu, processing transactions, checking balance, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and logout

📂 Project Structure (screenshot above)
The project is organized into clear folders:

Domain – Entities, Enums, Interfaces

UI – Console screens & user interactions

ATMApp.cs – Main application logic

💡 Why this project?
Strengthened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming

Practiced designing a real, interactive console application

Learned to keep code clean, reusable, and easy to extend
