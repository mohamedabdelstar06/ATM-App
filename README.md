## 📌 **About the Project**

This is a simple yet complete **ATM Console Application built in C#**, designed and developed entirely by **me 👨‍💻**.  
The project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in practice, and shows how to structure a small but real-world console application.

It's based on a tutorial from YouTube, but I **built it myself** from scratch — adding my own touch, structure, and improvements to understand and apply OOP better.

## ✨ **Features**

✅ **User login** with card number & PIN validation  
✅ **Account balance check**  
✅ **Cash deposit** (with amount validation & note summary)  
✅ **Withdrawal** (choose predefined amounts or enter custom amount)  
✅ **Internal transfer** to other accounts  
✅ **View transactions** (pending implementation)  
✅ Clean, modular, and extendable code following **OOP best practices**

## 🛠 **Technologies & Skills Applied**

- **C#** (.NET)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Classes, Enums, Interfaces)
- User input validation & error handling
- Console UI & menu system
- Visual Studio project structuring

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

Clone the project and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedabdelstar06/ATM-App.git
cd ATM-App

# Open in Visual Studio and run

🎥 Project Idea & Inspiration
In this project, I practiced and applied key OOP concepts, including:

Creating the Visual Studio project and structuring it properly

Designing classes, interfaces, and enums to keep code organized

Writing the ATM logic: login, transactions, deposits, withdrawals, transfers

Handling validation, error messages, and user experience in the console

The idea comes from a two-part tutorial:

Part 1: Welcome screen, login system, validating card number & PIN

Part 2: Displaying menu, processing transactions, checking balance, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and logout

📂 Project Structure (screenshot above)
The project is organized into clear folders:

Domain – Entities, Enums, Interfaces

UI – Console screens & user interactions

ATMApp.cs – Main application logic

💡 Why this project?
Strengthened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming

Practiced designing a real, interactive console application

Learned to keep code clean, reusable, and easy to extend
