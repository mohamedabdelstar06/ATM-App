## 📌 **About the Project**

This is a simple yet complete **ATM Console Application built in C#**, designed and developed entirely by **me 👨‍💻**.  
The project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in practice, and shows how to structure a small but real-world console application.

It's based on a tutorial from YouTube, but I **built it myself** from scratch — adding my own touch, structure, and improvements to understand and apply OOP better.

## ✨ **Features**

✅ **User login** with card number & PIN validation  
✅ **Account balance check**  
✅ **Cash deposit** (with amount validation & note summary)  
✅ **Withdrawal** (choose predefined amounts or enter custom amount)  
✅ **Internal transfer** to other accounts  
✅ **View transactions** (pending implementation)  
✅ Clean, modular, and extendable code following **OOP best practices**

## 🛠 **Technologies & Skills Applied**

- **C#** (.NET)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Classes, Enums, Interfaces)
- User input validation & error handling
- Console UI & menu system
- Visual Studio project structuring

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

Clone the project and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedabdelstar06/ATM-App.git
cd ATM-App

# Open in Visual Studio and run

## 🎥 **Project Idea & Inspiration**

In this project, I practiced and applied key **OOP concepts**, including:

- **Designing classes, interfaces, enums** to keep code organized & maintainable
- **Writing ATM logic:** login, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, logout
- **Handling validation, user experience, and clear error messages**

The idea comes from a **two-part tutorial**:
- **Part 1:** Welcome screen, login system, validating card number & PIN
- **Part 2:** Displaying the menu, processing deposits, withdrawals, transfers, viewing transactions & logout

## 📂 **Project Structure** *(shown in screenshot)*

The project is divided into clean folders:

- `Domain` – **Entities, Enums, Interfaces**
- `UI` – **Screens & user interaction**
- `ATMApp.cs` – **Core application logic**

## 💡 **Why I built this**

- To **solidify my OOP knowledge** by building something real
- **Practice clean code & modular structure**
- **Learn to handle real user scenarios** in a console app
