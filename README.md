## 📌 **About the Project**

This is a simple yet complete **ATM Console Application built in C#**, designed and developed entirely by **me 👨‍💻**.  
The project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in practice, and shows how to structure a small but real-world console application.

It's based on a tutorial from YouTube, but I **built it myself** from scratch — adding my own touch, structure, and improvements to understand and apply OOP better.
